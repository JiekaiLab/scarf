# SCARF: A Single Cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq Foundation Model

SCARF is a large-scale foundation model designed for **single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq**.  
It provides pretrained weights, preprocessing pipelines, and tutorials to accelerate downstream biological discovery.

## ⚙️ Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JiekaiLab/scarf.git
cd scarf
```

### 2. Create conda environment and install dependencies

```bash
conda env create -n scarf -f environment.yml
```


## 📊 Quick start

We provide example datasets and pretrained models for quick testing. 

### Expected runtime on a normal desktop (40GB RAM, no GPU): ~2–3 minutes

### Run SCARF on your own data

1. Preprocess your single-cell data ([preprocess.ipynb](./downstream_tasks/preprocess.ipynb))  

2. Run inference ([embedding.ipynb](./downstream_tasks/embedding.ipynb))  


## 🎯Downstream Tasks

We provide ready-to-use Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to apply **SCARF** to different downstream tasks:

- **Cell type prediction** ([CellType_prediction.ipynb](./downstream_tasks/CellType_prediction.ipynb))  
  Predicts cell type labels from multi-omic embeddings.

- **Cell Matching** ([Cell-matching.ipynb](./downstream_tasks/Cell-matching.ipynb))  
  Aligns and matches cells across modalities (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq).

- **Cell RNA-Inference** ([RNA-Inference.ipynb](./downstream_tasks/RNA-Inference.ipynb))  
  Predicts gene expression of cells through scATAC-seq data.
